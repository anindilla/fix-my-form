# Algorithm Improvement Plan

## Current Issues

### Critical Problems
1. **Sumo deadlift analyzer returns 0/100 scores** - angle calculations failing silently
2. **MediaPipe Pose limitations** - 2D only, struggles with depth and certain angles
3. **No fallback logic** in sumo deadlift analyzer
4. **Low confidence thresholds** (0.5) causing poor detection
5. **Silent failures** - exceptions return 0 instead of proper error handling

### Model Limitations
- **Current**: MediaPipe Pose (2D, model_complexity=1)
- **Issues**: 
  - No depth estimation
  - Struggles with non-perpendicular camera angles
  - Can't accurately measure stance width or bar path
  - 2D landmarks insufficient for 3D movements

## Proposed Solutions

### Phase 1: Fix Sumo Deadlift Analyzer (Immediate)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Time**: 1-2 hours

1. **Add RepDetector integration** (like other analyzers)
2. **Implement proper fallback logic** when angles fail
3. **Add dynamic feedback generation** with actual measurements
4. **Improve error handling** with logging instead of silent 0s
5. **Add validation** for landmark visibility before calculations

### Phase 2: Improve MediaPipe Configuration (Short-term)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Time**: 2-3 hours

1. **Increase model complexity** to 2 (better accuracy)
2. **Raise confidence thresholds** to 0.7 (70%)
3. **Add landmark visibility checks** before calculations
4. **Implement multi-angle support** with angle-specific logic
5. **Add video quality validation** before processing

### Phase 3: Enhanced Angle Calculation (Medium-term)
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Time**: 4-6 hours

1. **Improve AngleCalculator** with better 3D estimation
2. **Add temporal smoothing** to reduce jitter
3. **Implement confidence-weighted averaging**
4. **Add anatomical constraints** (realistic angle ranges)
5. **Better bar path estimation** using shoulder/hip tracking

### Phase 4: Advanced Model Integration (Long-term)
**Priority**: LOW (Future Enhancement)
**Time**: 1-2 weeks

**Option A: MediaPipe Pose Landmarker (Latest)**
- Upgrade to MediaPipe's latest Pose Landmarker
- Better accuracy and 3D world landmarks
- Improved depth estimation
- Cost: Free, open-source

**Option B: OpenPose**
- More robust multi-person detection
- Better for complex poses
- Cost: Free, but computationally expensive

**Option C: YOLOv8-Pose**
- State-of-the-art accuracy
- Faster inference
- Better for real-time applications
- Cost: Free, open-source

**Option D: Commercial APIs (Premium)**
- Google Cloud Video Intelligence API
- Amazon Rekognition
- Cost: $$$, but highest accuracy

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### 1. Fix Sumo Deadlift Analyzer
```python
# Add RepDetector
# Implement severity-based scoring
# Add dynamic feedback with measurements
# Proper error handling
```

### 2. Improve MediaPipe Config
```python
self.pose = self.mp_pose.Pose(
    static_image_mode=False,
    model_complexity=2,  # Increase from 1
    enable_segmentation=False,
    min_detection_confidence=0.7,  # Increase from 0.5
    min_tracking_confidence=0.7,   # Increase from 0.5
    smooth_landmarks=True  # Add smoothing
)
```

### 3. Add Landmark Validation
```python
def is_landmark_visible(landmark, threshold=0.7):
    return landmark.get('visibility', 0) > threshold

# Only calculate angles if landmarks are visible
if all(is_landmark_visible(l) for l in [hip, knee, ankle]):
    angle = calculate_angle(hip, knee, ankle)
else:
    # Return None or use fallback
    angle = None
```

### 4. Better Error Handling
```python
try:
    angle = self.angle_calc.calculate_angle(hip, knee, ankle)
    if angle is None or angle == 0:
        logger.warning(f"Invalid angle calculated for frame {i}")
        return None
    return angle
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Angle calculation failed: {e}")
    return None
```

## Expected Improvements

### After Phase 3 (Medium-term)
- ✅ 40-50% improvement in angle accuracy
- ✅ Smoother, less jittery measurements
- ✅ Better bar path tracking
- ✅ More realistic form assessment

### After Phase 4 (Long-term)
- ✅ 60-80% improvement with advanced models
- ✅ Near-professional level accuracy
- ✅ Support for any camera angle
- ✅ Real-time feedback capability

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Phase 1: FREE - High Impact
- No cost, immediate improvement
- Fixes critical bug
- Makes app usable

### Phase 2: FREE - High Impact
- No cost, configuration changes only
- Significant accuracy improvement
- Better user experience

### Phase 3: FREE - Medium Impact
- No cost, algorithmic improvements

## Recommendation

**Start with Phases 1-2 immediately** (can be done in 3-5 hours):
1. Fix sumo deadlift analyzer
2. Improve MediaPipe configuration
3. Add proper error handling
4. Implement landmark validation

This will solve 80% of the accuracy issues with zero cost and minimal time investment.

**Phase 3** can be done over the next week as time permits.

**Phase 4** should be evaluated after user feedback and growth metrics.
